// "Normative Wording" section

The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy defines the terms 'Scope',
'Compliant Portion', and 'Necessary Patent Claims'.

Some parts of this Specification are purely informative and so are EXCLUDED
from the Scope of this Specification.
The <<introduction-document-conventions,Document Conventions>> section of
the <<introduction>> defines how these parts of the Specification are
identified.

Where this Specification uses technical terminology, defined in the
<<appendix-glossary>> or otherwise, that refer to enabling technologies
that are not expressly set forth in this Specification, those enabling
technologies are EXCLUDED from the Scope of this Specification.
For clarity, enabling technologies not disclosed with particularity in this
Specification (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing technology, hardware
architecture, processor architecture or microarchitecture, memory
architecture, compiler technology, object oriented technology, basic
operating system technology, compression technology, algorithms, and so on)
are NOT to be considered expressly set forth; only those application program
interfaces and data structures disclosed with particularity are included in
the Scope of this Specification.

For purposes of the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy as it
relates to the definition of Necessary Patent Claims, all recommended or
optional features, behaviors and functionality set forth in this
Specification, if implemented, are considered to be included as Compliant
Portions.
