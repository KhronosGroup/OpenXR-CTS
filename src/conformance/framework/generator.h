/*!
 * @defgroup Generators
 *
 * @brief A generator is a way to "produce" a collection of values or objects one at a time.
 *
 * This type of generator is conceptually very similar to the Catch2 generators,
 * but simpler to understand with less magic - no variable magically takes multiple values,
 * the generator simply produces one value per loop which it moves to your ownership at your request.
 * It also allows production of objects (typically, creator functions for objects), and not just values.
 *
 * A value of GeneratorWrapper type is returned by a factory function for a generator:
 * the specific GeneratorBase subclass implementing it is hidden as implementation details.
 *
 * To use a generator, you create it (as a GeneratorWrapper value) using the factory function.
 * Then, you start a while loop. The condition for your loop is `generator.next()`.
 * In the body of the loop, you call `generator.get()` **a single time** to retrieve the generated value/object.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ```
 * // Generate every combination of these flags, including none of the flags.
 * auto&& generator = bitmaskGeneratorIncluding0({
 *      {"XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_UNORDERED_ACCESS_BIT", 0x00000004},
 *      {"XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT", 0x00000008},
 *      {"XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT", 0x00000010},
 *      {"XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT", 0x00000020},
 *      {"XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT", 0x00000040},
 * });
 * while (generator.next()) {
 *      auto val = generator.get();
 *      // Do something with val here
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In a test, you may use a `DYNAMIC_SECTION` to split iterations,
 * if only a single generated value should be used per test case execution.
 * Alternately, if you don't need to re-start the test case for each generated value,
 * you can record the appropriate data about this iteration with an `INFO` or a `CAPTURE`.
